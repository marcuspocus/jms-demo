bq. Don't forget to run @play deps --sync@ before running the app !

h2. Creating Routes (Queues or Topics)

View the @Bootstrap@ class to learn how to create routes

bc. RouteBuilder routes = new RouteBuilder(){
	public void configure() throws Exception{
		from("activemq:queue:myListener").id("chat").bean(MyListener.class);
		from("activemq:topic:chat").id("chat").bean(Application.class, "onMessage");
	}
}

* @MyListener.class@ is a standard class implementing @javax.jms.MessageListener@
* @Application.class@ is any class, the onMessage method just have a String parameter: The body of the @javax.jms.TextMessage@ will be transformed to a String.

bq. Read "Camel: Routes":http://camel.apache.org/routes.html for more details about routes.

The add routes to @CamelContext@ which will manage @ListenerContainer@.

bc. ctx.addRoutes(routes);

You get access to @CamelContext@ using Injection

bc. @Inject static CamelContext ctx;

To send messages from @Controllers@, @Jobs@, or @Mailer@ classes, you have access to @JmsTemplate@ via @Inject annotation:

bc. @Inject private static JmsTemplate jms;

bq. To send to a topic don't forget to set: @jms.setPubSubDomain(true)@
