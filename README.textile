h2. Creating Routes (Queues or Topics)

View the @Bootstrap@ class to learn how to create routes

bc. RouteBuilder routes = new RouteBuilder(){
	public void configure() throws Exception{
		from("activemq:queue:chat").id("chat").bean(Application.class, "onMessage");
		from("activemq:topic:chat").id("chat").bean(Application.class, "onMessage");
	}
}

The add routes to @CamelContext@ which will manage @ListenerContainer@.

bc. ctx.addRoutes(routes);

You get access to @CamelContext@ using Injection

bc. @Inject static CamelContext ctx;

To send messages from @Controllers@, @Jobs@, or @Mailer@ classes, you have access to @JmsTemplate@
